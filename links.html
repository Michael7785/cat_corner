                    <p class="list_text">Simon&apos;s Cat is a comic book and video series created by British animator (and avowed cat lover) Simon Tofield. It features Simon&apos;s cat, harassing its owner while exhibiting all the usual cat behaviors. Simon&apos;s cat is beautifully portrayed, representing a cartoonish version of the domesticated feline. If your cat has ever sat on your chest and meowed at 3am, you will relate to this comic.</p>
