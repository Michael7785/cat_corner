            <h2>Did you know...</h2>
            <p class="fact">House cats share 95.6% of their DNA with tigers. They share many of the same behaviours and habits, like peeing on things, stalking prey, pouncing, and trying to fit into cardboard boxes, even if they're too small.</p>
            <h2>Did you know...</h2>
            <p class="fact">Cats present their ... hindquarters ... as a sign of trust, safety and security. So when your cat sticks his butt in your face, <em>AGAIN,</em> it's because he loooooves you.</p>
            <h2>Did you know...</h2>
            <p class="fact">A housecat can run at a speed of 30 miles per hour over short distances. They could technically outrun Usain Bolt in a 200 meter dash. If you can get them off the couch, that is.</p>
